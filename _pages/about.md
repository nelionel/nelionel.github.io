Hi! I'm a 4th year student at MIT, studying Math and CS, focusing on deep learning. My research explores AI Alignment through mechanistic interpretability. I'm also planning to write a series of blogs (coming soon!): [Distilling my model of the AI-risk landscape](https://nelionel.github.io/).

Outside academics, I enjoy writing, running, tennis, badminton, and playing guitar.
