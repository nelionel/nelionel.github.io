Hi! I'm a 4^(th) year Math and CS student at MIT, focusing on deep learning. My research explores AI Alignment through mechanistic interpretability, and I'm writing about AI risk at my blog (coming soon!): [Distilling my model of the AI-risk landscape](https://nelionel.github.io/).

Outside academics, I enjoy writing, running, tennis, badminton, and playing guitar.
