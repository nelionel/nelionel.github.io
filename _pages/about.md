I am a 4th year undergraduate student at MIT majoring in Math and CS, with a focus on deep learning. Currently, I am exploring AI Alignment through mechanistic intereretability and I am trying to make sense of the pregressively more complex and urgent AI-risk landscape by writing a [series of blogs](https://nelionel.github.io/Distiling my model of the AI-risk landscape). It does not exist yet. 

In my free time I like to write, run, play tennis, badminton, and guitar.

Feel free to stalk me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010081325607). Ideally there would be a lot more cool stuff here.
