Currently, I am exploring AI Alignment through mechanistic intereretability and I am trying to make sense of the pregressively more complex and urgent AI-risk landscape by writing a <a href="https://nelionel.github.io/Distiling%20my%20model%20of%20the%20AI-risk%20landscape">series of blogs</a>. It does not exist yet.</p> <p>In my free time I like to write, run, play tennis, badminton, and guitar.</p> <p>Feel free to stalk me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010081325607" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">facebook</a>. Ideally there would be a lot more cool stuff here.</p> </body></html>
